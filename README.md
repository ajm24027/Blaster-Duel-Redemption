### **_Getting Started_**

#### **The Setting** üêÆ

In Blaster Duel Redemption you assume the role of a blaster pistol duelist in Wild Space. Your family's land is being illegally siezed by Space Barons who seek to turn your planet into one big Space Cow Farm. Though these Barons believe themselves above the law, they do abide by a singular code - The Code of the Duel.

All Barons must accept a challenge to duel, and upon losing, must relinquish all of their land and property to the winner of the duel.

#### **How To Duel** üî´

At the start of every duel, a pattern will show up at the top of the duel area, after a set time, this pattern will go away. Each duelist has a set time to input the correct pattern into their own blaster. The first duelist to correctly input the patter succesfully loads their blaster and hits their mark, thus winning the duel.

##### **Button Controls** üü†üîµ

Duelists will input the pattern that was on screen by using the given console controls. Two large circles, one orange, and one blue. Upon clicking either of the circles, that circles color will appear in the next available slot in the blaster. Duelists will click these buttons until the pattern is completed to the best of their recollection.

#### **The End Of The Duel** üéâ

If you succcesfully input the correct pattern within the time limit, you will hit your mark and move onto the next duel. The next duel will include a pattern with one more random circle within it, after a certain number of rounds, the time you have to complete each pattern will get shorter and shorter, a feature for the fastest of us.
